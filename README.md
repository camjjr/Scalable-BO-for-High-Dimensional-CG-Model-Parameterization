# Scalable BO for High Dimensional CG Model Parameterization

This repository contains the code and data used in our study on applying Bayesian Optimization (BO) to the parameterization of a high-dimensional coarse-grained (CG) model of the Pebax-1657 copolymer. We demonstrate that BO can efficiently optimize a 41-parameter CG model to reproduce key physical properties—density, radius of gyration, and glass transition temperature—using data from atomistic simulations.
